===================
Note from Developer
=================== 

Sorry if the CSS is a bit tedious, as this project is based on my first independant completed project for a small business that failed to
took off in Dec2018.

You can reach me through my email address Ariffakhrullah31@gmail.com or +673 8876629 if you need my service. Thank you.

------ Database ------
----------------------
The website currently *stores* its data such as the Product name, brands, image name, etc 
in the SQL database, which can be found /database/dbconfig.php file. 

----------------------
-- Ability to CRUD? --
----------------------
No, the website at its current state does not have any CRUD implemented as time were short during
development. But there are data in the database, which were inserted MANUALLY in the phpmyadmin.

Why? to make the coding shorter to DISPLAY all products and services to avoid repetition of coding (see services.php)

----------------------
-- Homepage banners --
----------------------
The banners in the homepage carousels size are 1000x250, just in case you wanted to add more banners and want consistent size.
